/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
